  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
  <h2>Full Name: Yobe Auwal Mohammed</h2>
  <h2>Track: Back-End {Node Js}</h2>
  <h2>Tech Experience: < 1 year </h2>
  <p>I am a very deep learner and am only confortable if I have sufficient knowledge about what I'm doing, I have always been passionate about the web since i learnt about it when I was younger. i work full-time as a tailor, a trade I have passion for but despite it's demand for time I still make time to learn and work on projects on web developement because the passion I have for it is bigger than anything else. I hope that with time, hardwork and appropriate mentorship I can acquire enough knowledge and skill and switch to my preferred field of profession. <br> I am seriously a team player and i like sharing ideas with like minds to find solutions.</p>
